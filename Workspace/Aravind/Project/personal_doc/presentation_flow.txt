1. 1st slide - Name of the project n team membs
2. agenda-> ppt struct
3. INtro-> 	
	The goal of the project and the achievments
	Very brief description of the two algorithm(less text)
5. Design
	system overview - diagram with control path and audio path   ----weihan
	5.3 audio path -FSYNC, I2s protocol, DAC/ADC data length, I2c, MCLK, 
	5.0 Simple algorithm
		power estimation, panning accumulator. we need to specify how many regs we used
		The reason of the complex algorithm-> In a stage since the position of the actor is not fixed the amplitude of the sound will reduce if 		actor moves away from the microphones.
	5.1 Complex algo -> blocks n don't forget the regs
			Position calculation --reson for the highpass filter	 ---------------------------Lexuan
			Filters--aravind
			Attenuation compensation		--aravind
	5.4 comparison of the simple algo and complex algo at the design level. compare the width and the length of the simple algo and complex algo,
		numbers. For cross correlation we need to have more data. atleast 280

6. Verification --Weihan
	6.0 methods- behavioral, matlab
	6.1 ethernet
		->The reason for ethernet
		
7. Results
	7.0 -> test enviornment - distance between the microphones and the size of the stage
	7.1 Slides showing the matlab results matches vhdl results  --aravind
		Figures showing the index and the position matlab vs VHDL
	7.2 perforamce Evaluation --aravind
			Figures showing the the results with/without hp filter
			System performance of the actors moving in x and y direction N state we have stable results.
			Mention the advantage of simple and complex.
	7.3 analysis based on con-audio path(simple vs complex) --aravind
		Figure showing the oscilloscope result		
		Hardware Utilization - Using BRAM in complex...
